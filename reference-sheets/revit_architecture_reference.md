## Troubleshooting and Performance

### Common Issues
```bash
Performance Tips:
- Close unnecessary views
- Use linked files instead of copying geometry
- Purge unused families and styles regularly
- Turn off unnecessary categories in 3D views
- Use view templates to control display
- Avoid excessive detail in early design phases

File Maintenance:
Purge Unused      # Remove unused elements
Compact File      # Reduce file size
Audit File        # Check file integrity
Detach from Central # Work offline
```

### Error Resolution
```bash
Warning Tools:
Warning Dialog    # Review warnings
Show Related      # Highlight problem elements
Delete Warnings   # Clear resolved warnings
Review Warnings   # Systematic review
```
