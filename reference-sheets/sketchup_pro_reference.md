## Precision Techniques

### Accurate Modeling
```bash
Precision Methods:

- Use tape measure for construction lines
- Set up guide lines and points
- Use inference system effectively
- Work at appropriate zoom levels
- Check model units (Window > Model Info > Units)

Construction Techniques:
- Start with simple shapes
- Use groups/components to isolate geometry
- Keep geometry on Layer0
- Use layers for visibility control only
- Build from inside out
- Check for gaps and overlaps regularly
```

### Measurement and Analysis

Model Analysis:
Window > Model Info # File statistics
Entity Info       # Selected object properties
Instructor        # Tool guidance
Area calculation  # Right-click > Area
Volume           # Solid Inspector (requires solid)

Measurement Tools:
- Tape measure (construction lines)
- Dimensions (annotation)
- Protractor (angles)
- Text tool (labels)
```

## Professional Workflows

### Architectural Modeling

6. Add details and components
7. Apply materials
8. Set up scenes
9. Export to LayOut

Best Practices:
- Model to real-world scale
- Use components for repeated elements
- Organize with layers and groups
- Keep raw geometry on Layer0
- Use scenes for different views
```

### Product Design
```bash
Design Process:
1. Sketch basic forms
2. Use Follow Me for complex shapes
3. Apply solid tools for boolean operations
4. Add details with components
5. Apply materials and textures
6. Create exploded views
7. Dimension in LayOut
8. Export for manufacturing

Quality Control:
- Check solid validity
- Verify dimensions
- Test 3D printing readiness
- Export appropriate formats
```

## Troubleshooting and Performance

### Common Issues
```bash
Performance Tips:
- Purge unused components/materials
- Use simplified components for distant objects
- Turn off unnecessary edge styles
- Hide complex geometry when not needed
- Work in orthographic views when possible
- Break large models into smaller files

Geometry Problems:
- Reversed faces (blue showing)
- Tiny faces/lines causing issues  
- Non-manifold geometry
- Overlapping coplanar faces
- Missing faces in push/pull operations
```

### File Management
```bash
File Maintenance:
Window > Model Info > Statistics
- Purge unused components
- Fix problems automatically
- Show nested components
- Component definition count

Backup Strategies:
- Auto-save settings
- Incremental save naming
- Regular purging
- Component library organization
```
